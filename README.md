# News Sentiment Voice

**NewsSentimentVoice** is a web-based application that extracts news articles from multiple sources, performs sentiment analysis, and generates a comparative sentiment report. The report is then translated to Hindi and converted into a TTS (text-to-speech) audio file. The application also sorts articles by their relevance to a provided company name using fuzzy matching.

  Uses RapidFuzz to rank articles based on how relevant they are to the provided company name.
- **Comparative Analysis:**  
  Generates a summary report displaying total articles and sentiment distribution.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**  
  Translates the report to Hindi and creates an audio file using gTTS.
- **Interactive Gradio Interface:**  
  A user-friendly interface that lets users input a company name and view results interactively.

## Technologies Used
